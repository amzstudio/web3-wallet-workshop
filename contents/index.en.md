# Web3 wallet Workshop

The purpose of this workshop is practicing query which is the new feature of AMB. We will use query on the console for BitCoin and Ethereum mainnet. And we can see the same result on the each network explorer like Bitcoin exploere and Etherscan. 
To make the dapp by using query API. We will deploy the lambda function which include the query api, and api gateway which call the lambda by cdk. After deploy the lambda and api gateway, We modify the lamda code and can see the how implement the dapp REST api. We can test this code through the rest api.
Lastly, We will modify the the api calling variable in the env file of the web3 wallet. And we can see the api result throught the we3 wallet dapp.
