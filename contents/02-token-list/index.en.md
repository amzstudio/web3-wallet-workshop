## There are a number of ways to check the balance of Ethereum or Bitcoin, or to identify the underlying token. The easiest way is to use an existing web service. [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is commonly used to look up Ethereum, and [Blockchain explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer) is commonly used for Bitcoin. You can also make these kind of services with AWS AMB Query! 

In this session, we are working with Ethereum/Bitcoin Balance and token holdings. You can see Etherscan example below.
